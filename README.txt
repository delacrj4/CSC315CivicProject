STAGE 5(a) 

In the zip file:
	-create tables
	-insertion statements that were generated by an outside source 
         and formatted to match our relations
	-queries saved in separate files
	-the successful outputs of the queries
	-raw database
	-other stages

STEPS TO HAVE A WORKING DATABASE:
1. Create database using PostgreSQL (PSQL)
2. Create tables using create_tables.txt
3. Populate tables using insert_tables.txt
4. Run queries
5. Compare outputs to 5a_Query_Output.sql

NOTE: For any queries with an "=", it is best to manually write the query in the terminal
      than copy and paste it.
